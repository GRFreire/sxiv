![sxiv](README/logo.png "sxiv")

**Simple X Image Viewer**

This is my fork of sxiv. I created this because a lot of features I found useful were spread around multiple forks of the [main repo](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv). C is not my main language (but I can code a bit with it), thats why you will probably see that most of the additions are from 3rd parties. Contributions are more than welcome ðŸ™ƒ.


Features
--------
_Those with a ``new`` before the feature are additions compared to the main repo_

* Basic image operations, e.g. zooming, panning, rotating
* Customizable key and mouse button mappings (in *config.h*)
* Thumbnail mode: grid of selectable previews of all images
* Ability to cache thumbnails for fast re-loading
* Basic support for multi-frame images
* Load all frames from GIF files and play GIF animations
* Display image information in status bar
* _(new)_ Load all images on parent directory
* _(new)_ Partial svg support (only on image mode for now)
* _(new)_ View images from URL
* _(new)_ Full webp support
* _(new)_ Start from file
* _(new)_ Configurable title
* _(new)_ Configurable bar colors

Dependencies
------------

sxiv requires the following software to be installed:

  * Imlib2
  * X11
  * Xft
  * freetype2
  * fontconfig
  * librsvg (optional, disabled with `HAVE_CAIRO_SVG=0`)

Please make sure to install the corresponding development packages in case that
you want to build sxiv on a distribution with separate runtime and development
packages (e.g. *-dev on Debian).


Building
--------

sxiv is built using the commands:

    $ make
    # make install

Please note, that the latter one requires root privileges.
By default, sxiv is installed using the prefix "/usr/local", so the full path
of the executable will be "/usr/local/bin/sxiv".

You can install sxiv into a directory of your choice by changing the second
command to:

    # make PREFIX="/your/dir" install

The build-time specific settings of sxiv can be found in the file *config.h*.
Please check and change them, so that they fit your needs.
If the file *config.h* does not already exist, then you have to create it with
the following command:

    $ make config.h


Usage
-----

Please see the [man page](http://GRFreire.github.io/sxiv/sxiv.1.html) for
